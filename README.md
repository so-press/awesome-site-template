# Awesome Site Template

Awesome Site Template is a CLI tool that helps you bootstrap a static website project using modern tooling. It bundles a development server, a build pipeline and scaffolding utilities so you can focus on writing HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.

## Features

- Development server with automatic rebuild and live reload
- Build task to compile SCSS, concatenate JavaScript and render Handlebars templates
- Generator for pages, components and fragments
- Uses Express, WebSockets and Chokidar under the hood

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g awesome-site-template
```

## Usage

The package exposes a single executable `awesome-site-template` that can be run with `npx`.

### Start the development server

```bash
npx awesome-site-template
```

The server watches your source files, rebuilds the site and reloads connected browsers whenever something changes. The default port is `3333` and can be overridden with the `PORT` environment variable.

### Build for production

```bash
npx awesome-site-template --build
```

This command empties the `dist` folder, builds assets and copies the `public` directory into `dist`.

### Generate a new item

```bash
npx awesome-site-template --gen
```

You will be prompted to create a page, component or fragment. The generator creates the directory and optional files for you.

## Project Structure

A typical project generated by this tool uses the following layout:

```
src/
  pages/
  components/
  fragments/
  globals/
  assets/
dist/
public/
```

Compiled HTML, CSS and JavaScript are written to the `dist` folder. The `public` folder is copied as-is during the build.
